## Recommendation

Based on the chess coaching website requirements and structure, I recommend **GitHub Pages** for the following reasons:

1. **Performance:** Chess websites benefit from fast loading times, especially for interactive chess boards
2. **Customization:** Complete control over HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for chess-specific features
3. **Cost:** Completely free with no ads or branding
4. **Reliability:** Backed by Microsoft's infrastructure
5. **Scalability:** Can grow with the coaching business
6. **Custom Domain:** Option to add a professional domain later

For form handling (contact page), we can integrate a free service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.

## Implementation Approach

1. Create a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website
2. Host the code on GitHub repository
3. Deploy using GitHub Pages
4. Add interactive chess features using JavaScript libraries
5. Implement responsive design for all devices
6. Use Formspree for the contact form functionality

This approach provides the best balance of:
- Professional appearance
- No recurring costs
- Full customization for chess-specific features
- Good performance for interactive elements
- Long-term sustainability
